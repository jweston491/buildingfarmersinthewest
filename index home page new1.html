					<p><strong>2013 Extension Risk Management Education Regional Priority</strong></p>
<hr />
                  <h2>Growing Small Farm and Ranch Businesses                  </h2>
<p><em>Applications that propose to utilize at least 70% of the  program components as laid out in the Building Farmers in the <a href="http://westrme.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/BFWNotebook_Final2012.pdf">West Local Coordinator Notebook</a> may qualify for train the trainer instruction which will be provided by our partner institution's Building Farmers in the West (BFW) leadership team at Colorado State University. </em></p>

If your Pre-Proposal is selected to move forward to the Full Proposal Stage the following information will be required:
	 <ul>
    <li>A letter of commitment from a member of the BFW leadership team at Colorado State University</li>
	<li>A dollar amount in your grant budget for train the trainer support </li>
	<li>Amount range – $2000 to $6000 (will depend upon level of train the trainer support needed)</li>
	<li>Sample Budget </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The purpose for this priority is to give applicant organizations serving beginning farmers and ranchers the opportunity to use existing methods and curriculum while leveraging partner resources  which can result in smaller funding requests.
</em></p>
                 <h2><br />
  Keystone Principles</h2>
<p>Two key elements of this program  ensure a solid foundation for new farmers: first, capacity is being built using  a classroom training program reinforced through interactions with University,  producer peers, and community resources; and second, the program builds a  strong network of producers involved in direct marketing that ultimately help  to strengthen local agriculture and food systems. </p>
<h2><br />
  Program Details</h2>
<p>Program delivery consists of a sequence of classes where participants learn about business  planning and accounting, regional direct marketing strategies, and business  development resources and partners. Course &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; are encouraged to apply for producer mentorships or other experiential learning options to  advance their business goals.</p> 
                
<h2><br />Motivation</h2>
<p>The growing demand for local, fresh  foods has created new market opportunities.   These opportunities seem to be particularly rich in Western states.  N
ew models of producing, marketing and  managing labor intensive produce operations require training for some of the  beginning farmers who are entering the industry to take advantage of new  markets, but also, transitioning commercial producers who may seek to learn a  different set of skills than their commodity-oriented operations required. </p>
<h2><br />
  Program Mission</h2>
<p>Beginning farmers who  are completing this program will be able to create and maintain economically viable  operations through the relevant knowledge, skills, tools, and experience this  project offers.  In addition to  traditional classroom education, participants  grow and learn through the  cooperation and education from community food organizations, successful  growers, and Land Grant universities.</p>

                    <h3 class="Green"><em><strong>&ldquo;</strong></em>Being able to articulate my mission and goals has led to a more focused approach to my business, which means saving money on expenses, less waste, and striving to purchase quality stock. This means an overall improvement in the business and a happier farmer and family. Our community has become aware of us as a quality operation through our efforts and media exposure.<em><strong>&rdquo; –- &nbsp;</strong></em><strong><em>Workshop participant&rsquo;s testimonial</em></strong>  [<a href="evaluations.html">more</a>...]</h3>

<p>Began as a regional partnership to build community and capacity among a new generation of direct market farmers and local food systems.</p>
<p><em>Building  Farmers in the West</em> targets and builds business planning capacity among  beginning farmers by extending successes reported in Colorado pilot programs.  Program delivery will focus on activities targeted to local food system  oriented producers: direct delivery of curriculum or training of partner educators, innovating experiential  learning strategies to complement classroom lessons, and evaluation of program  materials and delivery. </p>
