					<h1>Creating Capacity</h1>
					
                  <h2>Growing Small Farm and Ranch Businesses</h2>
<p>	Building Farmers in the West helped to build capacity and offered business development and management training to farmers and ranchers. Through a seven state collaborative effort, beginning food producers across the Western United States acquired relevant knowledge, skills and tools to help them successfully launch or grow their operations in emerging markets for specialty fresh produce and livestock products.</p>
<p>Program components laid out in the <a href="files/bfn-notebook-2012.pdf">Local Coordinator Notebook</a> provide a solid plan for organizations serving beginning farmers and ranchers and the opportunity to use reliable, science based methods and curriculum.  

</p>
                 <h2><br />
  Keystone Principles</h2>
<p>Two key elements of this program  ensure a solid foundation for new farmers: first, capacity is being built using  a classroom training program reinforced through interactions with University,  producer peers, and community resources; and second, the program builds a  strong network of producers involved in direct marketing that ultimately help  to strengthen local agriculture and food systems. </p>
<h2><br />
  Program Details</h2>
<p>Program delivery consists of a sequence of classes where participants learn about business  planning and accounting, regional direct marketing strategies, and business  development resources and partners. Course &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; are encouraged to apply for producer mentorships or other experiential learning options to  advance their business goals.</p> 
                
<h2><br />Motivation</h2>
<p>The growing demand for local, fresh  foods has created new market opportunities.   These opportunities seem to be particularly rich in Western states.  N
ew models of producing, marketing and  managing labor intensive produce operations require training for some of the  beginning farmers who are entering the industry to take advantage of new  markets, but also, transitioning commercial producers who may seek to learn a  different set of skills than their commodity-oriented operations required. </p>
<h2><br />
  Program Mission</h2>
<p>Beginning farmers who  are completing this program will be able to create and maintain economically viable  operations through the relevant knowledge, skills, tools, and experience this  project offers.  In addition to  traditional classroom education, participants  grow and learn through the  cooperation and education from community food organizations, successful  growers, and Land Grant universities.</p>

                    <h3 class="Green"><em><strong>&ldquo;</strong></em>Being able to articulate my mission and goals has led to a more focused approach to my business, which means saving money on expenses, less waste, and striving to purchase quality stock. This means an overall improvement in the business and a happier farmer and family. Our community has become aware of us as a quality operation through our efforts and media exposure.<em><strong>&rdquo; –- &nbsp;</strong></em><strong><em>Workshop participant testimonials</em></strong>  [<a href="evaluations.html">more</a>...]</h3>
