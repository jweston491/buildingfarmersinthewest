				  <h1>What new knowledge will farmers gain?<br />
				  </h1>

This program is directed to producers who want to learn how to successfully manage and grow a direct marketing enterprise of high-value crops. A primary goal of the program is to help these producers understand and manage the risks inherent in businesses that are selling directly to consumers through new marketing channels (such as farmers' markets, produce stands, community supported agriculture subscriptions, and other direct marketing avenues).				  </p>
